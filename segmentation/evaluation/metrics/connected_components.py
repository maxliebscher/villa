    """
    Computes the average absolute difference in connected component counts between the ground truth and predicted masks,
    averaged over the batch, for each class and overall.

    Parameters
    ----------
    label : Any
        Ground truth segmentation mask as a NumPy array with integer labels in [0, num_classes-1].
        Expected shape: [H, W, D] for a single volume or [N, H, W, D] for a batch.
    prediction : Any
        Predicted segmentation mask. Can be either:
          - A probability map with shape [N, num_classes, H, D] (will be converted to hard labels via argmax), or
          - A hard label map with shape [H, W, D] or [N, H, W, D].
    num_classes : int
        Total number of classes.
    ignore_index : Optional[int], default None
        Class index to ignore (e.g., background) in the computation.
    connectivity : int, default 26
        Connectivity used by cc3d.connected_components

    Returns
    -------
    Dict[str, float]
        Dictionary with keys "connected_components_class_X" (for each class X not ignored) containing the average absolute difference 
        in connected component counts, and a key "connected_components_total" for the overall difference.
